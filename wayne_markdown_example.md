Markdown.css is better default styling for your Markdown files. It's heavily
inspired by the [Space](http://getspace.org) WordPress theme. This page is
itself a Markdown file using the `markdown.css` stylesheet. 

### Sample File

View a sample file that implements most of the Markdown spec
[here](http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss/sample.html).

### Get Started

Just add the following line to the top of your `.markdown`
files:

    <link href="http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss/markdown.css" rel="stylesheet"></link>

##### Note:
    
For the markdown to parse correctly, you need to add the closing `<link>`
tag. This is not technically correct HTML, but it will parse in any browser.
